# Carlos Iguaran

Computer scientist (MSc, UBA - University of Buenos Aires, 2017). 8+ years experience in the tech industry working on production-level software. 

In recent years I've specialized in computational aspects of bayesian inference. I am a BlackJax contributor. To learn more check [My PRs and issues list](https://github.com/users/ciguaran/projects/1) and the [BlackJax Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10797).

I am interested in software engineering for scientific computing, the modelling of statistical problems as programs and the implementation of inference algorithms such as MCMC and SMC.

Currently working on applied problems on constrained optimization and optimal만xperimental design on top of bayesian models.
